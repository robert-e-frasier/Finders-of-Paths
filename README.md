# Finders of Paths

### ***"Because 'Door Bookman' deserves a better off the fly name."***

## Description
Finders of Paths is a project to help DMs escape that all-too-familiar nightmare: "Uhhh... the NPC's name is… ahhh... Steve? No, no… Door... Book… ahhh... yeah! Door Bookman! He's the potion guy! Wait, he sells arrows of healing?! Uh-oh… you rolled a nat 20 on persuasion?!? AHHHHHH!"

Yeah. We've all been there, staring into the void while the players' eyes bore holes into our soul.

Now, you just answer a few quick, brain-sparking questions in the menu, and BAM — instant NPC, fully equipped with a name, personality, quirks, and stats to actually back up that charisma check. Don't like it? Mash that regenerate button like you’re rolling for crits until you find the one that feels just right. Once you're happy, you can save that NPC straight to your Dashboard and assign them wherever you want. Homeless bard? Shady street vendor? Mysterious old librarian who might secretly be a dragon? You bet.

But hold on to your dice bag — there’s more. You get a whole section for shops and their goods. Yup, you can stockpile all the weird gear, rare potions, or overpriced souvenirs your players will definitely try to steal. Need to spin up a new town on the fly because your players took "just one more left turn"? No problem. You can name streets and shops automatically, populate them with shopkeepers, and even generate townsfolk so your town feels alive (or at least suspiciously full of gnomes).

Days pass? Players go off chasing geese for a week and come back expecting things to be the same? Think again. Enter how many days went by, tell the app which items are trending (spicy pickled owlbear eggs, anyone?), and it’ll simulate the economy. Shops lose stock on hot items, gain new wares, and adjust prices based on trade routes with other cities you’ve built. Oh, you didn’t know? Yeah — you can create entire cities, and link them with rivalries, alliances, and questionable trade deals that would make any royal treasurer cry.

And we’re not stopping at people and shops. You can create custom items, give them stats, enchantments, weird curses, or whatever twisted thing you can think up at 3 a.m. when you should probably be sleeping. You can design monsters too — create new horrors, assign stats, give them secret abilities your players will definitely regret discovering.

Oh, you want realms and planes? Good news — we’ve got you covered there too. Build entire worlds, realms, and weird dimensional side pockets that only exist because "the wizard was bored." You provide the imagination, we handle the connections and sanity checks (well… mostly).

NPCs might be fast, but the bigger your imagination, the deeper the web of connections. Welcome to the rabbit hole. The beautiful, terrifying rabbit hole where your players only see 5% of your genius, but that’s okay — because you’ll know it’s there, and that’s what matters.

We’re here to save you weeks of prep time, reduce your table panic rolls to zero, and help you build a living world that feels vibrant, hilarious, dangerous, and always one player decision away from complete chaos.

So grab your dice, pour another mug of questionable tavern ale, and get ready to build the world your players will never forget. Or probably break. Let’s be honest — they’ll break it. But at least you’ll be ready.

## 🛠️ Contributing

So, you want to help expand the madness? Awesome! We welcome brave adventurers (uh, contributors) who want to build, tweak, or add new features to **Finders of Paths**.

Before you dive in swinging your code sword, here’s what you need to know:

- **Read the LICENSE file first.** No, really. Just like reading that mysterious scroll before you accidentally summon a demon goat — it matters. It details what you can (and cannot) do, and ensures we all play by the same magical rules.
- **We use Electron.** Yup, this app runs as a sleek, offline desktop window thanks to Electron magic under the hood — no web browser required! So, keep that in mind when working with code and modules.
- **Every file you submit must include this license header at the top (or as close as possible):**

For **C++**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, **JSON**, and general code files:
```js
/*
Finders of Paths License v1.0
See LICENSE file in the root of this repository for details.
Unauthorized commercial use is prohibited.
*/
```

For **HTML** files:
```html
<!--
Finders of Paths License v1.0
See LICENSE file in the root of this repository for details.
Unauthorized commercial use is prohibited.
-->
```

- **Stick to the style and structure.** We don’t want the codebase turning into a chaotic gelatinous cube with random bones and half-melted scripts inside. Keep things clean and consistent so other adventurers can understand your spells.
- **Write clear commit messages.** None of that “fixed stuff” or “idk maybe works??” business. Be descriptive so we can understand your quest log and track changes like a well-kept spellbook.
- **Submit a pull request when you’re ready.** We’ll review it faster than a bard starts a tavern brawl. If changes are needed, we’ll let you know so your contribution can reach its final form.
- **Be kind, respect the project, and remember — it’s a collaborative adventure.** We’re all here to build an epic tool together, and that means good vibes only.

Thanks for wanting to join the party — now grab your keyboard, prepare your spell slots (or functions), and let’s make something legendary together!
